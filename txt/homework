Hey girl, are you my homework?

Because you're probably really really good for me and
it would be a good idea for me to try and persue you
in hopes of self improvement but I'm just lying here
thinking about it instead of actually bucking up and
doing anything about it and it's making me feel horrible
about myself. Perhaps I don't even deserve the benefits
and emotional confidence I'd have earned from you had
I just engaged and tried to be a better person. I'm going
to die alone, dreaming of the life I could have had, had I
just learned to act, rather than dream.

Also uhhh because I should be slamming you on my
desk and doing you all night hehehehehehehehehe.
