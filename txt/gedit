I don't like Vim becuase i use gedit. Gedit provies me with all the tools and shortcuts I need, e.g. Ctrl+A selects all the text in the file. Ctrl+C copies all the text to the clipboard. Ctrl+V pastes the clipboard's text into the file. Ctrl+S autoamtically saves the file. I don't like the VIm way of doing it, which is ":wq" Also when I want to open Vim I have to open a terminal first which is an inconveienenence for me in my opinion. But on Ubuntu I just need to press the Windows key and search for a program. Then I open Gedit. It's like magic! I dont need know much more then that. That's what I love about gedit, it's so simple and easy! I can also easily change the color schemes, but on the terminal it's kind of harder to do it. But everyone has different opinions so it's ok if u like Vim!
