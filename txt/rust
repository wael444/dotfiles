It is year 2028 and Linux has been completely rewritten in Rust.

After adding Rust support to Linux kernel in 2021 Linux repo has been
flooded with patches and pull requests from brave Rustaceans rewriting
critical components in Rust to ensure their stability and memory safety
that C could never guarantee. After a few painful years of code reviews
and salt coming from C programmers losing their jobs left and right
we have finally achieved a 100% Rust Linux kernel. Not a single kernel
panic or crash has been reported ever since. In fact, the kernel was so
stable that Microsoft gave up all their efforts in Windows as we know
it, rewrote it in Rust, and Windows became just another distro in the
Linux ecosystem. Other projects and companies soon followed the trend
- if you install any Linux distro nowadays it won't come with grep,
du or cat - there is only ripgrep, dust and bat. Do you use a graphical
interface? Good luck using deprecated projects such as Wayland, Gnome or
KDE - wayland-rs , Rsome and RDE is where it's all at. The only serious
browser available is Servo and it holds 98% of the market share. Every
new game released to the market, including those made by AAA developers,
is using the most stable, fast and user-friendly game engine - Bevy
v4.20. People love their system and how stable, safe and incredibly fast
it is. Proprietary software is basically non-existent at this point. By
the year 2035 every single printer, laptop, industrial robot, rocket,
autonomous car, submarine, sex toy is powered by software written in
Rust. And they never crash or fail. The world is so prosperous and stable
that we have finally achieved world peace.

can tell from his eyes... That he is truly proud of his community.
